# Hi, I'm Artem Zhyto 😎

**Middle Fullstack Developer (Next.js / Node.js) | Future Aerospace Engineer**

I build full‑cycle web applications: design, frontend, backend, infrastructure, and deployment. I am following a structured plan to develop myself in the areas that matter most. Currently, I am learning **Python** and exploring various **algorithms** on it, preparing for the next stages of my development.

## Tech Stack 💻

* **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Sass, Redux
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Prisma, Mailer, Winston
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis
* **Tools:** Docker, Git, CI/CD, Testing Frameworks

## What I Focus On 🎯

* High‑performance web applications
* Secure and stable backend architecture
* Clean and maintainable code
* Educational and socially valuable products

## Current Projects 🚀

* **Phys&Math education** – an educational platform for mathematics and physics
* **Math tasks generator** – a server‑driven school math trainer
* **QuCore Dynamic** – a collection of interconnected products and services

## Goals 🏆

* Build my own technology company
* Develop products that bring real value to people
* Move toward aerospace‑related technologies and advanced materials

## Professional Focus 🛠️

I approach development as an engineering discipline. My core priorities include:

* Designing scalable, predictable system architectures
* Ensuring fault tolerance and reliability in backend services
* Applying strict security practices in middleware, sessions, and API design
* Optimizing performance across the entire stack, from database queries to UI rendering

## Development Philosophy 💡

* **Clarity over complexity:** every module, function, and interface must be unambiguous.
* **Predictability:** code should behave consistently under load and unexpected conditions.
* **Maintainability:** any part of the project should be understandable months later.
* **Performance by design:** optimization is not an afterthought.

## Current Engineering Directions ⚙️

* Building educational platforms with large content volumes and dynamic server‑side logic
* Creating reusable component libraries and internal tooling for automation
* Enhancing security layers for authentication, authorization, and rate-limiting
* Designing modular architectures for multi‑product ecosystems (QuCore Dynamic)

## Tools & Workflows I Use 🧰

* Git-based workflow with structured commits and automated checks
* CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) for testing, linting, and deployments
* Containerized environments with Docker for infrastructure consistency
* Multi-tier architecture with API gateways, caching layers, and database optimizations

## Long-Term Outlook 🌠

I plan to:

* Establish a technology company combining software, AI, and engineering products
* Build an R&D division focused on aerospace, plasma physics, and advanced materials
* Contribute to technologies that make human expansion into space more attainable
* Develop robust software infrastructures supporting large-scale scientific platforms
