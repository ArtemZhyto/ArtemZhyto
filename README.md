# Hi, I'm Artem Zhyto 😎

**Software Engineer**

I design and build full-cycle web systems - from architectural planning and UI implementation to backend infrastructure and deployment pipelines. I approach software development as an engineering discipline focused on scalability, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

I have completed Calculus I–III and actively apply mathematical analysis in system modeling and algorithmic reasoning, including in my project ORBITA.
